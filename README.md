## Description

The goal of this program is to beat the clumsy bird game by Ellison Lao. You can find the game here (http://www.ellison.rocks/clumsy-bird/)

To run the program:

'''
python main.py
'''

This will record the screen and run the resulting image through the filtering and tracking programs.

## Setup

The camera will lag on a resolution that is too high. The recommended resolution is 1024x640.

## Future Developments

There are currently no actuators in the program. Right now, it merely tracks the bird and the pipes.
